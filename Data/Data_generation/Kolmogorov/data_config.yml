n_sims: 10000               ## Number of training sims to run
n_traj: 5        ## Number of training trajectories per simulation, so the total number of trajectory is n_sims * trajectories
chunk_size: 1000        ## Number of simulation steps to process at once (reduce if still getting OOM)

nsteps: 128               ## Number of emulator timesteps to save for training, i.e. the length of a training rollout
dt: 0.001               ## Numerical timestep for jax_cfd
Dt: 0.002               ## Actually saved steps for training e.g. an emulator step
spinup: 5000           ## How many numerical timesteps to run before storing snapshots, also known as spinup phase
decorr_steps: 872      ## How many numerical timesteps to seperate training trajectories by. Better to make is so that (traj_T - spinup) mod (nsteps + decorr_steps) = 0

reynolds: 10000         ## Reynolds number
gridsize: 512           ## Simulation gridsize
downsample: 8           ## Downsampling factor for emulator fields
